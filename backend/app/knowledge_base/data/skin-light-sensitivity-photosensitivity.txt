Skin light sensitivity (photosensitivity)
Skin light sensitivity (photosensitivity) means you have an unusual reaction to light. This can cause symptoms like pain, redness, itching or a rash when the skin is exposed to light. These symptoms can range from very mild to very severe.
There are different types of light sensitivity conditions. Some are very common and others are rarer. They can affect anyone, including people of different ages and skin types.
Types of light sensitivity
Light sensitivity conditions can be put into different groups depending on what causes them.
Immunological
Some light sensitivity conditions happen when the immune system reacts unusually to light. This includes light sensitivity conditions like:
polymorphic light eruption
juvenile spring eruption
chronic actinic dermatitis
solar urticaria
actinic prurigo
actinic folliculitis
hydroa vacciniforme
Drugs or chemicals
Light sensitivity symptoms can be a side effect of some drugs or chemicals, for example:
doxycycline
quinolone antibiotics like ciprofloxacin
bendroflumethiazide and other thiazides
quinine
calcium channel blockers
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) – although these rarely contribute to light sensitivity
phenothiazines (including chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine)
St John’s Wort
These are just examples of drugs that may cause light sensitivity and this is not an exhaustive list.
Speak to a healthcare professional if you’re worried about the side effects of medication. Do not stop taking any medication without speaking to your healthcare professional first.
Genetic
Some light sensitivity conditions are caused by a genetic alteration. This includes:
Xeroderma Pigmentosum
Cockayne Syndrome
Bloom Syndrome
Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome
Photoaggravated skin diseases
Photoaggravated skin diseases are light sensitivity conditions. These conditions are not caused by light but can be triggered or worsened by exposure to light.
Some examples of photoaggravated light sensitivity conditions include:
rosacea
lupus erythematosus
atopic dermatitis
psoriasis
Darier disease
dermatomyositis
pemphigus vulgaris or foliaceus
Light sensitivity symptoms
Skin light sensitivity means that you get symptoms when the skin is exposed to light. Some common symptoms include:
skin rash
skin pain
itching
a burning or heat sensation on the skin
blistering or fragile skin
sunburn that happens very easily
These symptoms can range from mild to severe. Sometimes people may also feel generally unwell due to a light sensitivity disease. For example, you may get headaches or fatigue.
Although it’s rarer, some people may have unusual freckling or scarring of the skin.
Light sensitivity rash
Some light sensitivity rashes may only occur on exposed sites during summer. But, a rash that’s caused by light sensitivity can also happen:
all year round
through light clothing
through windows and indoor light
There may be no rash on areas that have a natural shadow like:
under the chin
the upper eyelids
behind the ears
You may also notice that the rash stops where you have been covered by clothing or footwear.
Diagnosing light sensitivity
You should speak to your GP if you think that you have a light sensitivity condition. If necessary, your GP may refer you to a dermatologist.
Most people will not need to be referred for light sensitivity testing. But, if you do, your dermatologist may refer you to a light testing centre. In Scotland, this is at
NHS Tayside’s Photobiology Unit.
Treatments for light sensitivity
A light sensitivity rash may be prevented with sun protection and by avoiding the sun.
Your doctor will tell you if you need any other treatments. This could include light-based treatments or immune suppressant treatments.
Psychological support may be needed if light sensitivity affects your day-to-day life.
You may also need to take a vitamin D supplement if you have a light sensitivity condition.
