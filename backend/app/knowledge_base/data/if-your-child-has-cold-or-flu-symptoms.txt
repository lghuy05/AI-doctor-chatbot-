If your child has cold or flu symptoms
Viral infections like cold and flu are very common in babies and children and most will make a full recovery without needing treatment. There are some things you can do to help them feel better.
Phone 999 or go to A&E if your child:
has lips or skin that are turning pale, blue or grey – on brown or black skin this is easier to see on the palms of their hands
has severe difficulty breathing – they may make grunting noises or suck their stomach in under their ribcage
is breathing fast or stops or pauses
is pulling in at their throat area (tracheal tug) or their windpipe is more prominent
is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do – they may find it difficult to focus on you or are more difficult to wake up than usual
is less than 3 months old and has a temperature of 38°C (101°F) or above and has not had a vaccination in the past 2 days
is less than 3 months old and has a temperature of 36°C (97°F) or less and has not had a vaccination in the past 2 days
Always trust your instincts and phone 999 if you think there’s an emergency.
Contact your GP practice urgently if your child:
is more short of breath than usual
has pain when breathing in or coughing
is feeling confused, dizzy or lightheaded
feels sick or is being sick – for example, they can’t keep food or fluids down
is coughing up blood (haemoptysis)
has had a dry nappy for 12 hours or more, or is showing other signs of
dehydration
has a very high or low temperature – for example, they feel either hot or cold to touch or are shivering
If your GP practice is closed, phone 111.

Possible causes of cold and flu symptoms
The most common causes of cold and flu symptoms in children are viral infections including:
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

There are several others but these are the most common. Most of the time these viruses don’t lead to serious illness.
There are some conditions which can cause cold and flu symptoms and may require further treatment, such as:
pneumonia
tonsillitis in toddlers and older children
Who’s most at risk?
Babies and children born with the following health conditions may be more at risk of serious infection:
congenital heart disease where a baby is born with a heart condition
babies born with narrowing of the airways or other respiratory disease
babies born prematurely
Preventing the spread of colds and flu
To reduce the risk of getting or spreading cold or flu you should:
make sure you wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water
clean surfaces (such as your telephone and door handles) regularly to get rid of germs
put used tissues in a bin as soon as possible
keep your child at home until they’re feeling better (without fever for 24 hours without infant paracetamol or ibuprofen)
