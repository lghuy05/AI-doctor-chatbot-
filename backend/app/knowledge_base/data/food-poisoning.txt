Food poisoning
Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It’s not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.
In most cases, food is contaminated by bacteria or a virus like:
campylobacter – the most common cause of food poisoning
salmonella
Escherichia coli (E. coli)
norovirus
listeria
Food Standards Scotland
has further information about bacteria and viruses that can cause food poisoning.
Symptoms of food poisoning
Symptoms of food poisoning include:
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
diarrhoea
, which may contain blood or mucus
stomach cramps and abdominal pain
a lack of energy and weakness
loss of appetite
a high temperature of 38C or above (fever)
aching muscles
chills
The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within 1 to 2 days of eating contaminated food. They can also start a few hours later or several weeks later.
What to do if you have food poisoning
Do
stay off school or work until you have not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least 2 days
rest
drink lots of water to prevent dehydration – you can sip it if this is easier
consider speaking to your pharmacist about an oral rehydration solution (ORS)
eat when you feel up to it – try small, light meals
eat bland foods like toast, crackers, banana and rice until you feel better
avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks, spice and fatty foods – they may make you feel worse
Speak to a GP if you:
have a weak immune system – for example, because of medication, cancer treatment or HIV
have severe symptoms
are pregnant
don’t start to see improvements to your symptoms after a few days
are unable to keep down any fluids because you’re vomiting repeatedly
have symptoms of severe dehydration, like confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine
are over 60
think your baby or young child has food poisoning
have a long-term underlying condition, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diabetes or kidney disease
How you get food poisoning
Food poisoning is caused by eating something that’s been contaminated with germs. Any type of food can cause food poisoning.
Food can be contaminated if it’s
not cooked or reheated thoroughly
not stored correctly – for example, it’s not been frozen or chilled
left out for too long
handled by someone who’s ill or hasn’t washed their hands
eaten after its ‘use by’ date
not reheating cooked food well enough

Preventing infection when you’re ill
Do
try to keep contact with vulnerable people to a minimum, for example the very young or elderly
wash your hands with soap and warm water often
clean surfaces, toilet seats, flush handles, basins and taps often
make sure everyone in the household has their own towels and flannels
wash the laundry of the infected person on the hottest washing machine setting
