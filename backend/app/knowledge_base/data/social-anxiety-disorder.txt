There isn’t always a clear cause for social anxiety.
Sometimes it might be caused by:

psychological – you have poor social skills or think that others are paying close attention to you
biological reasons – you may be more likely to be socially anxious if someone is your family is also socially anxious
It’s most likely that your socially anxious feelings come from a combination of all of these factors.
