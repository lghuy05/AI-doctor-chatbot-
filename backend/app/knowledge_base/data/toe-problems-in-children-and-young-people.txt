Toe problems in children and young people
Children’s toes are small and very flexible. It’s common for children’s toes to overlap each other and appear curled.
Most curling, overlapping, or under-riding of children’s toes improves slowly as their feet grow.
Although the toes can look unusual it’s rare for this to cause any pain or problems. Having curly toes does not affect a child’s ability to walk or cause them to trip up.
What can I do if I am concerned my child has toe problems?
The most important thing for a child’s foot development is to make sure that they have the right sized shoes. This means that children should have their feet measured regularly.
As children grow, their toes become less flexible and lie straighter. This happens naturally and is not affected by strapping, toe splints or special shoes.

Is surgery helpful for toe problems in children?
There’s no simple operation to straighten a child’s toe. Surgery can result in a stiff, short and painful toe which is worse than a curled up but painless one.
Surgery on children’s toes would only be considered if the curled toe is painful and blistering.
What if I’m still concerned about my child’s toes?
Contact a healthcare professional if your are still worried about your child’s toe problems. They can discuss the situation with you and decide if any further assessment is needed.
