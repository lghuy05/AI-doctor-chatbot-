A fever is usually when your body temperature is 38°C or higher. You may feel warm, cold or shivery.
You can find out if you have a fever (high temperature) by using a thermometer to take your temperature.
You should try to stay at home and avoid other people if you have a high temperature, to avoid spreading potential illness.

What causes a fever?
A fever is your body’s natural response to many common illnesses such as:
flu
tonsillitis
kidney or urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Fever helps your body fight infections by stimulating your immune system (your body’s natural defence). By increasing your body’s temperature, a fever makes it harder for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive.
