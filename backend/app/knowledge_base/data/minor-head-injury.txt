Minor head injury
A minor head injury is an injury (like a bump or a cut) to the head that doesn’t result in any serious brain injury. Sometimes a minor head injury can cause
concussion
, but this is not always the case.
It can be hard to tell the difference between a minor and a severe head injury.

Treating a minor head injury
Most people who go to hospital with a minor head injury can return home shortly afterwards. They should make a full recovery within a few days.
There are some things you can do to manage minor head injuries at home. You should:
have someone stay with you for 24 hours after the injury to watch for
serious symptoms
appearing
get plenty of rest
avoid stressful or noisy situations
limit screen time (including smartphones)
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to help with mild pain, following all instructions on the packaging
use a cold compress (like a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel) to help soothe the injury
keep children with a head injury calm, and encourage them to avoid rough play
It’s also recommended that you:
avoid alcohol or recreational drugs
avoid sleeping pills, sedatives or tranquillisers (unless prescribed by a medical professional)
use a barrier (like a tea towel) between a cold compress and your skin
avoid using a cold compress for longer than 30 minutes, or more often than every 2 hours
avoid playing contact sports for at least 3 weeks, and follow
return to sport guidelines
avoid returning to work or school until you feel able, as it may increase your recovery period
avoid driving a car, motorbike, bicycle, or operating machinery, until you have no symptoms that affect your ability to see or think
If your child has a minor head injury, they may cry or be distressed. This is normal – with attention and reassurance most children will settle down. However, seek medical help if your child continues to be distressed despite simple measures like pain relief.
Contact your GP if:
you still have symptoms 2 weeks after the injury
you’re unsure about driving or returning to sports, work, or school

Preventing a minor head injury
Injuries cannot be completely avoided, but there are some steps you can take to help reduce the risk of more serious injury. You could:
wear a helmet that fits well when doing activities like cycling
wear safety equipment when playing contact sports
clear up any spillages quickly to avoid someone slipping
use safety equipment if you’re doing any kind of DIY
fit safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs for young children
follow health and safety guidance at work
