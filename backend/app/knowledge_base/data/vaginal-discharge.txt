Vaginal discharge
You can experience vaginal discharge for many reasons. It doesn’t always mean you have an STI.
Vaginal discharge is nothing to worry about if it’s:
odourless (no unpleasant smell)
clear or white
thick and sticky
slippery and wet
The amount of discharge you might experience can vary. You might experience heavier or more frequent discharge if you’re:
pregnant
sexually active
using
contraception
, such as the contraceptive pill
During ovulation, you’ll notice more slippery and wet discharge, which is normal.
Contact your GP or sexual health service if:
You have vaginal discharge and:
you experience pelvic pain
you’re bleeding between periods or after sex
you experience pain when peeing
you feel itchy, sore or have blisters
your vaginal discharge changes in colour, smell or texture
You should look out for anything that doesn’t seem normal for you. This can include discharge which is:
foul-smelling
thick and white (like cottage cheese)
green or yellow and frothy
accompanied by pain or bleeding
accompanied by itchiness, blister or sores
STIs that can cause vaginal discharge include:
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
genital herpes
trichomonas
If you’re sexually active and you experience any abnormal discharge,
contact your local sexual health clinic
to get tested for STIs.
Vaginal discharge can also be caused by
thrush
or
bacterial vaginosis
.
You might be asked to visit your local sexual health clinic for a vaginal examination to ensure you get the correct treatment.

Genital hygiene
You can’t always prevent vaginal discharge. But it’s important to keep your vagina clean and healthy. Your vagina cleans itself internally. So you don’t need to clean inside with things like a vaginal douche.
You can use panty liners if you experience heavy discharge. But don’t use them all the time as they can cause irritation.
