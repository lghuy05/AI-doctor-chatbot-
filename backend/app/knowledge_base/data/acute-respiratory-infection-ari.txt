Information on acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms, treatments and when to seek medical advice.
Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) affect parts of the body that are used for breathing, such as the sinuses, throat or
lungs and airways
.
Most ARIs are caused by viruses. Others are caused by bacteria. Examples of ARIs include:
common cold

RSV
coronavirus (COVID-19)
slapped cheek syndrome
ARIs often get better by themselves but may sometimes be treated with
antibiotics
.

a new continuous
cough
sneezing
a blocked or runny nose
a
sore throat
a
headache
muscle aches
shortness of breath
, tight chest or wheezing
a high temperature (
fever
) – this is usually about 38°C or higher (100.4°F)
feeling generally unwell
feeling tired or have a lack of energy
Less common symptoms
Less common symptoms of acute respiratory infections include:

Some respiratory infections, such as the common cold and RSV, may also lead to
middle ear infection
,
sinusitis
and in younger children,
croup
.
If you have symptoms
If you have respiratory symptoms, you should:
stay away from people at increased risk of becoming more unwell from respiratory infections, if possible
not visit hospitals or care homes
You may still have a
cough
or feel tired after your other symptoms have gone. This doesn’t mean that you’re still infectious to others.

When to get medical advice
Phone 999 or go to A&E if:
You or your child:

are coughing up blood (haemoptysis)
collapses, faints, or has a
seizure
or fit for the first time
feel more drowsy than usual or find it more difficult to wake up
have lips or skin that are turning pale, blue or grey – on brown or black skin this is easier to see on the palms of their hands
have blotchy or mottled skin

meningitis now
Speak to your GP practice if you:

are worried about your child
have had a high temperature for more than 3 days
have a temperature below 36°C

Treatment for ARIs
Most acute respiratory infections pass within 3 weeks. There are some things you can do to help relieve your symptoms until the infection clears up.
Things you can do to help your symptoms
Do
rest
drink plenty of fluids
eat healthily
take over-the-counter pain relief, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
, to relieve high temperature and aches
use
decongestant
sprays or tablets to relieve a blocked nose
use extra pillows to raise your head while sleeping to make breathing easier and clear your chest of mucus
try remedies such as gargling salt water and sucking on menthol sweets
Don’t
do not smoke – this can make your symptoms worse
do not take paracetamol and flu remedies that contain paracetamol at the same time
do not give
aspirin
to children under 16
Treatment from a pharmacist
You can speak to a pharmacist for advice about acute respiratory infections and the treatments available. Your pharmacist can also advise you on whether you need to see a GP about your symptoms.

Treatment from a GP
Treatment for acute respiratory infections depends on what’s causing the infection.
If the infection is caused by a virus, like the
common cold
, your GP will not prescribe antibiotics.
Your GP may prescribe
antibiotics
if the infection is caused by bacteria, for example, if you have a
chest infection
.

How to reduce the spread of infection
There are things you can do to reduce the spread of acute respiratory infection.
Do
cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze
wash your hands regularly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser after coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, and before you eat or handle food
regularly clean frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles and remote controls, and shared areas such as kitchens and bathrooms
ventilate rooms you have been in by opening windows
stay at home until you no longer have a fever (if you had one) and don’t need medicine to lower your fever
if you have been asked to attend a medical or dental appointment in person, tell them about your symptoms before attending
let people you’ve recently been in contact with know that you’re feeling unwell, so they can watch for symptoms, especially if they’re at higher risk of getting ill from a respiratory infection
tell anyone who needs to come into your home that you have respiratory symptoms
wear a face mask or face covering if you need to leave your home whilst unwell
try to avoid busy or crowded spaces with poor ventilation
Don’t
do not have close contact with anyone who is at increased risk of becoming more unwell from an ARI, especially individuals with a weakened immune system, if you can avoid it
