Popliteal cysts in children and young people
A popliteal cyst is a fluid-filled swelling. It appears at the back of the knee in some children. This usually isn’t harmful or a sign of infection.
Causes of a popliteal cyst
Popliteal cysts can develop in children for no clear reason. They can appear around the tendons at the back of the knee or at the back of the knee joint itself. This causes it to swell and appear large.
Treatment for a popliteal cyst
Popliteal cysts don’t need treatment. They can come and go for up to 2 years.
We don’t recommend operations to remove these cysts as this is more painful than having the cyst. They often come back after an operation.
When should I speak to a healthcare professional?
Contact your healthcare professional if:
your child is complaining of significant pain where the cyst is
it’s restricting their movement
the swelling doesn’t reduce and keeps getting bigger
